# natours
This is a webpage made during Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and Sass course. Natours is a fake company that let's people sign up for nature tours, and the website uses a float-based layout. 

View the page here: https://nkemdianyiam.github.io/natours/. Any button that's supposed to take you to another page does not actually function.
